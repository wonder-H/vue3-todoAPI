### 4. Study keywords 😊

1. CRUD features through API
2. Trying Tailwindcss
3. Vuex to set state of data

<br>

### 5. P.S 🤔

- Tried using Vuex for management of data(state)
- Focused on CRUD features(hasn't been refactoring yet)
- Felt using SCSS with Tailwindcss is not a good idea..(efficiency)
- Need more study for state management to improve handling data
- Importance using modules to divide features in store(vuex)
